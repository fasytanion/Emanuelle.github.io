        Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Davidâ€¦ honey, my pookie bear. I have
        loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into
        the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth
        touch around the bar, and that gorgeous deadlifts. I would do anything
        for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to
        watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope.
        You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father,
        sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of
        the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were
        the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have
        given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you
        first left Estonia and its like my heart got broken into a million
        pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win
        your first powerlifting competition, because deep down, my glorious king
        deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my
        sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us
        baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back from 3-1 and I
        couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious
        king exclaim these words, "Estonia! , THIS IS FOR YOU!" Not only have
        you changed the fitness industry and the world forever, but you've
        eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the
        goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, David laid.
